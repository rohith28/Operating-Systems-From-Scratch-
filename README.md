# Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-

As part of COMP520 - Operating Systems coursework, I created a basic operating system from scratch.

# Tools used :
1) Oracle VM virtual box 
2) virtual hard drive image file OS.VDI

# Steps for installing and implementation 
Instructions on setting up the virtualbox image:
# Step 1: Download VirtualBox for your computer
Go here:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
# Step 2: Copy the virtual hard drive image OS.VDI to your
computer. This is a very large image, over 4GB! Give yourself
plenty of time and make sure you have the space. You can get it
from this link:

# Step 3: Follow the instructions here to import the image into
virtualbox and make a new virtual machine:

In the options, select Linux as your operating system and Ubuntu 32
bit as your version.
# Step 4:
Boot the virtual machine. The Ubuntu desktop should come up
within about one to five minutes, depending on the speed of your
computer.
On the desktop you should see a set of folders labeled Project A, B,
C, D, E, and F. You should also see a file simulator.jar, and at the
top of the screen you should see a button to open the terminal.
# Step 5:
Double click on simulator.jar. Press Boot Floppy A: If you see a
screen come up after a minute or so with the message “It Works”,
then you're ready to start the project. 


# Stages in Building the Operating System :

1) Booting (Project_A)(https://github.com/rohith28/Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-/tree/master/ProjectA)
2) System Calls (Project_B) (https://github.com/rohith28/Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-/tree/master/ProjectB)
3) Loading Files and Executing programs (Project_C) (https://github.com/rohith28/Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-/tree/master/ProjectC)
4) Writing Files and Improving the Shell (Project_D) (https://github.com/rohith28/Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-/tree/master/ProjectD)
5) Processes and MultiTasking (Project_E) (https://github.com/rohith28/Operating-Systems-From-Scratch-/tree/master/ProjectE)
